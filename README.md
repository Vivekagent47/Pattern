# Pattern
In this problem, you need to print the pattern
         > 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
         > 4 3 3 3 3 3 4
         > 4 3 2 2 2 3 4
         > 4 3 2 1 2 3 4
         > 4 3 2 2 3 3 4
         > 4 3 3 3 3 3 4
         > 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
In this programe we create this type of the pattern valid form 1 to 9.

#Solution Approach-
  I break it in different patterns, thats make me easy to think.
  first I break it into
 > 4 4 4 4
 > 4 3 3 3
 > 4 3 2 2
 > 4 3 2 1
  
  then I saw that this is similar to the right side of the pattern that I create, 
  after that I saw that the upper part is similar to the lower part of the pattern.
  
  That it. Now the whole pattern is complete.
